    "There are two ways to inject code to watch a program run: tracing and profiling. They are similar, but intended for different purposes and so have different constraints. The easiest, but least efficient, way to monitor a program is through a trace hook, which can be used to write a debugger, monitor code coverage, or achieve many other purposes.\n",

    "The trace hook is modified by passing a callback function to sys.settrace(). The callback will receive three arguments: the stack frame from the code being run, a string naming the type of notification, and an event-specific argument value. the table below lists the seven event types for different levels of information that occur as a program is being executed.\n",
